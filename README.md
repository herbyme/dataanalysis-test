Test for insights into data analytics

From the csv file determine the following using a programming language:

1. What is the 'most common' crime according to the data?
2. What were the 3 dates that had the 'most' crime
3. Which addresses/geo locations (lat-long) in Sacremento had the highest crime rates?
4. If you can map out the geo-locations into 'geo-fenced hot spots' for crime in Sacremento what would it look like? Bonus if you can show this on a map (e.g. using Google Maps API or Open Maps API)
5. What other data insights can you deduce from the data provided?
6. Any discrepancies with the data provided? If you can source any other data from anywhere, what data would you get? Where would you get it from? Bonus if you can demonstrate this
